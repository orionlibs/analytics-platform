# Grafana Frontend React Exercise. 

Thanks for taking your time to work on this with us! 

## Instructions
> Note: We'll be using this as the base of your virtual on-site technical excercise. The on-site round will build on top of this assessment.

1. Clone this repository to your local.

2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed.

3. To start the project, run `npm start`. This runs the app in the development mode.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

5. The repository comes with built in CSS using `emotions`. Feel free to use a different library if it is easier.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on the button should call fetch last location and display data in a new row in the table.

2. In the table, display a timestamp of the call, and the execution time of each call.

3. At the bottom, display the fastest time, slowest time, and average time

4. `App.tsx` comes with a fake endpoint called `fetchLastLocations`. Please do not modify the file `fetchLastLocations`. 

5. Once completed, upload it to a repository and send the repository link back to your recruiter.
