# :warning: UPSTREAM CHANGES. DO NOT MERGE MANUALLY.

This automated pull request was created by the [$WORKFLOW_NAME]($GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$GITHUB_RUN_ID) workflow.

There are updates from upstream to be merged, but our local changes conflict with the upstream changes so we need to resolve the merge manually.

To merge the changes manually, use the following commands:
```
# Checkout the branch
git checkout $HEAD_REF
# Reset the branch to main
git reset --hard origin/main
# Pull changes from upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/actions/runner-images.git
git fetch upstream
# Merge the changes
git merge -m "Merge commit '$UPSTREAM_SHA' from actions/runner-images" $UPSTREAM_SHA

# Solve the conflicts and continue the merge
git merge --continue

# Push the changes to the branch
git push --force-with-lease origin $HEAD_REF
```

Once you have merged the changes successfully, please get somebody else to review and approve this pull request. The bot will then handle merging the changes to `main`. Do not merge manually.

If you need the bot to update the pull request and redo the merge process, you can do so by leaving a review requesting changes with the comment `bot change`.

When you are ready for the bot to merge these changes, you can do so by leaving a review approving the changes with the comment `bot merge`.

### :x: CONFLICTS DURING MERGE. PLEASE HANDLE THE CONFLICTS APPROPRIATELY.
