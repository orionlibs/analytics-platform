# Grafanacon Custom Data Source Plugin 

This repo builds the documentation and api necessary for our [Hands On Lab at Grafanacon 2025](https://grafana.com/events/grafanacon/2025/hands-on-labs/). The server it builds runs on `localhost:8080`. It runs a simpler version of our target api that will run locally on our machine and it also will contain links to [all of the example code we plan to write together](https://github.com/grafana/grafanacon-custom-data-source-plugin-example).

## Prerequisites
Before we get started please make sure you have installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- Go 1.22
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) version of Node.js
- Git 

## Setup (DO THIS NOW)

Run the **scaffolding** command to generate a new plugin's boilerplate from a template:
1. Find a place on your file system where you'd like to create a new folder for your plugin
2. `npx @grafana/create-plugin@latest` (creates it's own folder, downloads template, and starts wizard):
   - Select a plugin type: data source
   - Add a backend to support server-side functionality?: y
   - Enter a name for your plugin: test
   - Enter your organization name: my-test-org
3. `cd ./mytestorg-test-datasource`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run dev` (keep this running in a separate tab throughout the workshop, it will watch frontend files and compile them)
7. `mage -v && docker compose up` (or specify the build for your machine to speed it up ex: `mage -v build:linuxARM64`)
9. open http://localhost:3000

Note: Conference wifi can be spotty and `npm install` can take a while to run. If npm install is taking forever consider using your phone as a hotspot temporarily! Or wait a few minutes and try again! Or if your neighbor's is working, consider pairing together. 

## Our Target API: Seattle Open Data -- Road Weather Station

A grafana data source plugin queries data from an external api and then visualizes it in grafana. Our project for today will be to build a data source plugin that connects to [Seattle Open Data's Road Weather Station Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Road-Weather-Information-Stations/egc4-d24i/about_data). As internet bandwidth can sometimes be in limited supply at conferences, we've duplicated their api and data to run locally in a very small no dependency go server. For the purposes of this workshop, we encourage you to run it on your machine. However after this workshop, it should be easy to edit your configuration settings to connect to a [live endpoint](#live-data-after-workshop).

### Running the Target API Locally 

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/grafanacon-custom-data-source-plugin.git
   ```
2. Change director into the repo you just created
   ```
   cd grafanacon-custom-data-source-plugin
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
5. Navigate to the running server you just started in your web browser: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Available endpoints

- Docs: http://localhost:8080/
- All data: http://localhost:8080/resource/egc4-d24i.json?$$app_token=good
- Filter data by station name: http://localhost:8080/resource/egc4-d24i.json?$$app_token=good&stationname=JoseRizalBridgeNorth
- Internal access by docker: http://host.docker.internal:8080/resource/egc4-d24i.json?$$app_token=good
- Workshop commits: http://localhost:8080/#workshop-commits


## Live Data (after workshop)
Once you have better internet access, you may wish to update your plugin to use a real API endpoint rather than this local dupe. To do so: 

1. [Sign up for an access token](https://data.seattle.gov/signup)
2. In your datasource configuration change your domain to with https://data.seattle.gov/ and swap out "good" for your app token.

So that requests go from:

`http://localhost:8080/resource/egc4-d24i.json?$$app_token=good&stationname=SpokaneSwingBridge`

to this:

`https://data.seattle.gov/resource/egc4-d24i.json?$$app_token={a real app token you get from data.seattle.gov}&stationname=SpokaneSwingBridge`

Explore the api docs here: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.seattle.gov/egc4-d24i

There are lots of ways to extend your plugin after this talk! Some things to try after this workshop:
- adding support for geolocation coordinates
- supporting [SoQL queries](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/)
- connecting to other datasets (resources beyond egc4-d24i)
- building out query vs builder mode
- practice writing e2e tests withour testing framework
