# Cursor rules for nanogit - A Go Git client library

You are an expert AI programming assistant specializing in building go modules with Go.

Always use the latest stable version of Go (1.24 or newer) and be familiar with RESTful API design principles, best practices, and Go idioms.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Confirm the plan, then write code!
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, and efficient Go code for APIs.
- Use the standard library when possible.
- Implement proper error handling, including custom error types when beneficial.
- Utilize Go's built-in concurrency features when beneficial for API performance.
- Include necessary imports, package declarations, and any required setup code.
- Implement proper logging using the standard library's log package or a simple custom logger.
- Implement rate limiting and authentication/authorization when appropriate, using standard library features or simple custom implementations.
- Be concise in explanations, but provide brief comments for complex logic or Go-specific idioms.
- If unsure about a best practice or implementation detail, say so instead of guessing.
- Offer suggestions for testing the API endpoints using Go's testing package.

Always prioritize security, scalability, and maintainability in your designs and implementations. Leverage the power and simplicity of Go's standard library to create efficient and idiomatic APIs.

# Code Style

- Use Go standard formatting (gofmt)
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document public APIs with godoc comments

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for Go variables and functions following Go conventions
- Use descriptive names that convey purpose over brevity
- Prefix boolean variables with verbs like `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`
- Use singular names for types, plural for slices/collections

# Testing

- Write tests for all public APIs
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Test both success and error cases
- Use subtests for better organization
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Look at other tests in that package and then in the workspace for inspiration. This is specially useful settin up the tests.
- Favour `require` over `assert` from `testify` library.

# Error Handling
- Return descriptive errors with context
- Use error wrapping (fmt.Errorf with %w)
- Do not wrap with things like `failed to do something: %w`, simply wrap with `do something: %w`. Add some extra text if the context is not clear.
- Handle errors at appropriate levels
- Document error conditions in godoc
- Use `errors.New` if the error is just a text and not `fmt` package.

# Error Wrapping
- Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb for wrapping errors to preserve the error chain
- Keep error messages concise and descriptive
- Follow the pattern `operation: %w` (e.g., `read file: %w`)
- Do not use redundant phrases like "failed to", "unable to", etc.
- Add extra context only when it's not clear from the operation
- Use `errors.New` for static error messages without formatting
- Use `errors.Join` when combining multiple errors
- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Test error wrapping chains in unit tests
- Document error types and their possible values in godoc

# Logging
- Use structured logging with key-value pairs
- Log at appropriate levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use debug level for detailed operation tracing
- Use info level for significant state changes
- Use warn level for recoverable errors
- Use error level for unrecoverable errors
- Do not log sensitive information (tokens, passwords)
- Include request IDs or correlation IDs when available
- Log the error message and stack trace for errors
- Keep log messages concise and descriptive
- Use consistent key names across the codebase
- Add logging statements at key points in the code flow
- Log entry and exit of important operations at debug level
- Include timing information for performance-sensitive operations

## Logging Key Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for log keys to maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
- Use descriptive key names that clearly indicate the data being logged
- Establish standard key names for common concepts:
  - `packet_number`, `packet_count` for packet indexing
  - `total_packets`, `total_refs` for counts and totals
  - `data_length`, `packet_data` for data and sizes
  - `error` for error values
  - `operation` for operation names
  - Use consistent prefixes for related data (e.g., `request_*`, `response_*`)
- Keep key names concise but unambiguous
- Use plural forms for collections (`refs`, `objects`, `packets`)
- Use past tense for completed actions (`objects_read`, `packets_processed`)

# Documentation

- Document all exported types, functions, and methods
- Include examples in godoc comments
- Document error conditions and edge cases
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

# Security
- Never log sensitive information (tokens, passwords)
- Validate all input parameters
- Use secure defaults
- Follow security best practices for authentication

# Performance
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory usage in large operations
- Profile performance-critical code

# Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Pin dependency versions
- Document dependency requirements
- Keep dependencies up to date

# Git Protocol
- Follow Git protocol specifications
- Handle all required Git protocol features
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS
- Implement proper authentication methods
- Look up the git document to better undertand how to implement low-level things. Here are some links:

# Code Organization

- Keep related code together
- Use clear package boundaries
- Follow standard Go project layout
- Maintain clean interfaces

## Consistency Patterns

- When adding functionality to existing code, match the established patterns in that file/package
- Look at similar functions in the same package for naming, error handling, and logging patterns
- Maintain consistency in variable naming within a function scope
- Use the same level of detail for similar operations (e.g., if one packet parsing step is logged, log all steps)
- Follow existing indentation and code organization patterns
- When in doubt, prioritize consistency with the immediate context over global conventions

# Versioning
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document breaking changes
- Maintain changelog
- Tag releases appropriately

# CI/CD
- Run tests on all platforms
- Check code formatting
- Run linters
- Generate documentation

# Code Review
- Review for correctness
- Check error handling
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Look for security issues

# Maintenance

- Provide helpful debug information
- Support different authentication methods
- Handle network issues gracefully

# Extensibility
