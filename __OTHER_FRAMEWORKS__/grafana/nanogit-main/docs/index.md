## Overview

nanogit is a lightweight, cloud-native Git implementation designed for applications that need efficient Git operations over HTTPS without the complexity and resource overhead of traditional Git implementations.

## Features

- **HTTPS-only Git operations** - Works with any Git service supporting Smart HTTP Protocol v2 (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), eliminating the need for SSH key management in cloud environments

- **Stateless architecture** - No local .git directory dependency, making it perfect for serverless functions, containers, and microservices where persistent local state isn't available or desired

- **Memory-optimized design** - Streaming packfile operations and configurable writing modes minimize memory usage, crucial for bulk operations and memory-constrained environments

- **Flexible storage architecture** - Pluggable object storage and configurable writing modes allow optimization for different deployment patterns, from high-performance in-memory operations to memory-efficient disk-based processing

- **Cloud-native authentication** - Built-in support for Basic Auth and API tokens, designed for automated workflows and CI/CD systems without interactive authentication

- **Essential Git operations** - Focused on core functionality (read/write objects, commit operations, diffing) without the complexity of full Git implementations, reducing attack surface and resource requirements

- **High performance** - Significantly faster than traditional Git implementations for common cloud operations, with up to 300x speed improvements for certain scenarios

## Non-Goals

The following features are explicitly not supported:

- `git://` and Git-over-SSH protocols
- File protocol (local Git operations)
- Commit signing and signature verification
- Git hooks
- Git configuration management
- Direct .git directory access
- "Dumb" servers
- Complex permissions (all objects use mode 0644)

## Why nanogit?

While [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) is a mature Git implementation, nanogit is designed for cloud-native, multitenant environments requiring minimal, stateless operations.

| Feature        | nanogit                                                | go-git                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Protocol       | HTTPS-only                                             | All protocols          |
| Storage        | Stateless, configurable object storage + writing modes | Local disk operations  |
| Cloning        | Path filtering with glob patterns, shallow clones      | Full repository clones |
| Scope          | Essential operations only                              | Full Git functionality |
| Use Case       | Cloud services, multitenant                            | General purpose        |
| Resource Usage | Minimal footprint                                      | Full Git features      |

Choose nanogit for lightweight cloud services requiring stateless operations and minimal resources. Use go-git when you need full Git functionality, local operations, or advanced features.

These are some of the performance differences between nanogit and go-git in some of the measured scenarios:

| Scenario                                  | Speed       | Memory Usage |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| CreateFile (XL repo)                      | 306x faster | 186x less    |
| UpdateFile (XL repo)                      | 291x faster | 178x less    |
| DeleteFile (XL repo)                      | 302x faster | 175x less    |
| BulkCreateFiles (1000 files, medium repo) | 607x faster | 11x less     |
| CompareCommits (XL repo)                  | 60x faster  | 96x less     |
| GetFlatTree (XL repo)                     | 258x faster | 160x less    |
