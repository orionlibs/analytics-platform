# OTel Me If It's Right

Checker for if the implementation of OpenTelemetry instrumentation is correct by scanning the code in your repository, checking environment variables, validating your Grafana token and more.

## Usage

Requirement: Golang

## Installation

1. Install the `otel-checker` binary

   ```text
   go install github.com/grafana/otel-checker@latest
   ```

2. You can confirm it was installed with:

   ```terminal
   ❯ ls $GOPATH/bin
   otel-checker
   ```

## Flags

The available flags are shown below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->

```terminal
❯ otel-checker -h
Usage of otel-checker:
  -manual-instrumentation
    	Provide if your application is using manual instrumentation (auto instrumentation as default)
  -collector-config-path string
    	Path to collector's config.yaml file. Required if using Collector and the config file is not in the same location as the otel-checker is being executed from. E.g. "-collector-config-path=src/inst/"
  -components string
    	Instrumentation components to test, separated by ',' (required). Possible values: sdk, collector, beyla, alloy, grafana-cloud
  -debug
        Output debug information
  -instrumentation-file string
    	Name (including path) to instrumentation file. Required if using manual-instrumentation. E.g."-instrumentation-file=src/inst/instrumentation.js"
  -language string
    	Language used for instrumentation (required). Possible values: dotnet, go, java, js, python, ruby, php
  -package-json-path string
    	Path to package.json file. Required if instrumentation is in JavaScript and the file is not in the same location as the otel-checker is being executed from. E.g. "-package-json-path=src/inst/"
  -web-server
        Set if you would like the results served in a web server in addition to console output
```

## Checks

### Common Environment Variables

These checks are automatically performed for all languages and components.

- Best practices for setting common environment variables:
  - Service name
  - Exporter protocol

- Resource attributes checks:
  - Validates the presence of recommended OpenTelemetry resource attributes
  - Checks for the following attributes:
    - `service.name` (via `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` or in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`)
    - `service.namespace` (e.g., `shop`)
    - `deployment.environment.name` (e.g., `production`)
    - `service.instance.id` (e.g., `checkout-123`)
    - `service.version` (e.g., `1.2`)
  - For missing attributes, provides specific recommendations with example values
  - Follows the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/) for precedence (e.g., `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` takes precedence over `service.name` in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`)
  - Example warning: `Set OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.namespace=shop": An optional namespace for service.name`

### Grafana Cloud

Use the `-components=grafana-cloud` flag to check the following:

- Endpoints
- Authentication

### SDK

#### JavaScript

Use `-components=sdk -language=js` flag to check the following:

- Node version
- Required dependencies on package.json
- Required environment variables
- Resource detectors
- Dependencies compatible with Grafana Cloud
- Usage of Console Exporter
- Prints which libraries are supported based on the `package.json` in the current directory.

#### Python

Use `-components=sdk -language=python` flag to check the following:

- Prints which libraries are supported:
  - The used libraries are discovered from `requirements.txt` in the current directory.

#### .NET

Use `-components=sdk -language=dotnet` flag to check the following:

- .NET version
- Available instrumentation for .NET libraries and dependencies
- Auto-instrumentation environment variables

> [!NOTE]
> Only .NET 8.0 and higher are supported

#### Java

Use `-components=sdk -language=java` flag to check the following:

- Java version
- Prints which libraries (as discovered from a locally running maven or gradle) are supported:
  - With `-manual-instrumentation`, the libraries for manual instrumentation are printed.
  - Without `-manual-instrumentation`, it will print the libraries supported by the [Java Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/).
  - A maven or gradle wrapper will be used if found in the current directory or a parent directory.

#### Go

Use `-components=sdk -language=go` flag to check the following:

- Prints which libraries are supported for manual instrumentation
  based on the `go.mod` in the current directory.

#### Ruby

Use `-components=sdk -language=ruby` flag to check the following:

- Ruby version
- Bundler installation
- `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` exist
- Required dependencies installed
- Optional auto-instrumentation dependencies installed

#### PHP

Use `-components=sdk -language=php` flag to check the following:

- PHP version
- Composer installation
- `composer.json` and `composer.lock` exist
- Required dependencies in `composer.lock`
- Some auto-instrumentation dependencies installed

### Collector

Use `-components=collector` flag to check the following:

- Config receivers and exporters

### Beyla

Use `-components=beyla` flag to check the following:

- Environment variables

### Alloy

> [!NOTE]
> TBD
