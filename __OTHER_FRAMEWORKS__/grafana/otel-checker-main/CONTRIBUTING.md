## Using mise

We provide a `mise.toml` file with several useful commands to simplify common development tasks. [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) helps ensure consistent code quality and streamlines the development workflow.

### Available mise Commands

| Command          | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `mise run build` | Builds the application using `go install`       |
| `mise run test`  | Runs all tests in the project                   |
| `mise run clean` | Removes build artifacts and cleans the Go cache |
| `mise run fmt`   | Formats all Go code using `gofmt`               |
| `mise run lint`  | Lints the code using `golangci-lint`            |
| `mise run check` | Run all checks (test and lint)                  |
| `mise run deps`  | Updates dependencies using `go mod tidy`        |

## Contribution Workflow

1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes
4. Run `mise run fmt` to format your code
5. Run `mise run lint` to ensure code quality
6. Run `mise run test` to make sure all tests pass
7. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
8. Submit a pull request to the main repository

## Before Submitting Pull Requests

Please ensure:

1. Your code follows the project's style and conventions
2. All tests pass (`mise run test`)
3. Code is properly formatted (`mise run fmt`)
4. Linting passes without issues (`mise run lint`)

## Code Review Process

Once you submit a pull request:

1. Maintainers will review your code
2. They may request changes or improvements
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch
