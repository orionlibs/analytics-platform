# Welcome

Welcome to this Grafana Labs **Introduction to Loki** workshop. 

In this workshop, we'll go over the basics of Loki with:

- Navigating and exploring logs in Grafana

- Writing and running Loki queries

- Visualizing Loki query results on a dashboard

## Get ready for the workshop

To ensure a smooth start for the workshop, please follow the steps/checklist below before you join the event:

- For this workshop, you need to have Administrator access to a (non-shared) Grafana v11 or higher instance with the Logs Drilldown plugin installed. 
    
    - We recommend [signing up for our free Grafana Cloud tier](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user) which comes with a managed Grafana instance with the Logs Drilldown plugin preinstalled.

    - Or, if you are bringing your own Grafana instance to the workshop, please make sure that:
      
      - You have permissions to add data sources to Grafana and create dashboards.

      - You have installed the **Logs Drilldown** plugin, by going to Administration -> Plugins -> Logs Drilldown -> Install.

- Please ask your presenter for the details of the Loki, Prometheus and Tempo data sources to add to your Grafana instance. You will use these data sources during the workshop.

Please reach out with any questions you might have in the meantime.

Thank you and see you in the workshop!
