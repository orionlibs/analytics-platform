# Description:
# Publishes the plugin to the Grafana Plugin Catalog.
# The plugin must be built via the "ci" workflow before running this workflow.
# It does the following steps:
#  - Publishes the plugin to 'dev', 'ops', and 'prod' catalogs.
#  - ('prod' target only) Publishes docs to the website, if they exist.
#  - ('prod' target only) Creates a lightweight Git tag and a drafts a new GitHub.
#
#  This workflow can also publish a PR (or any other non-main branch), but only to the 'dev' catalog.
