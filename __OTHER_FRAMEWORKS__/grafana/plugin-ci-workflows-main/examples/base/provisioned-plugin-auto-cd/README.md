An example setup for a provisioned plugin with continuous delivery from the `main` branch. This is the **recommended** workflow to use for new plugins that want to be automatically installed on Grafana Cloud Instances.

- CI for each PR
- CI + CD for each push to main: deployment to the catalog and Grafana Cloud ("dev", and optionally also "ops") via Argo workflow + deployment_tools
- Manual deployment to the catalog and Grafana Cloud via Argo workflow + deployment_tools (for prod deployment)
