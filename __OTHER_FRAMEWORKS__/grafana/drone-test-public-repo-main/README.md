This is a repo used to test [drone-dev](https://drone-dev.grafana.net/grafana/drone-test-repo/).
It can be used to try new pipeline features, or to validate drone server upgrades.

Pipelines included (so far):

- PR build
- Master build

For tests that doesn't need a public repo setup fall back to [drone-test-repo](https://github.com/grafana/drone-test-repo).
This repository won't implement all features of that test repository.
