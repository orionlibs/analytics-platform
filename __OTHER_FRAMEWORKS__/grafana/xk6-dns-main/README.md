# xk6-dns

This is a DNS resolver extension for [k6](https://go.k6.io/k6). It allows you to resolve DNS names to IP addresses
in your k6 scripts. 

This extension was designed with the following goals in mind:
- Assert the performance of custom DNS servers under load.
- Provide a way to resolve DNS names to IP addresses using a specific DNS server in k6 scripts.

## Features

This extension provides two functions:
- [`dns.resolve()`](#dnsresolvequery-recordtype-options) - resolves a DNS name to an IP address using the provided DNS server.
- [`dns.lookup()`](#dnslookuphost) - resolves a DNS name to an IP address using the system's default DNS server.

## Usage

### Using the extension

To use this extension requires using the xk6 tool to build a custom k6 binary that includes the extension. You can install the extension using the following command:

```bash
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-dns
```

### Example k6 script

From there we can use the bustom built binary to run the following example script:

```javascript
import dns from 'k6/x/dns';

export const options = {
    vus: 10,
    duration: 200,
};

export default async function() {
    // Request the IP address of k6.io from the selected namerserver A records.
    const resolvedIP = await dns.resolve('k6.io', 'A', '9.9.9.9:53');
    console.log(`k6.io IPs as resolved against the 9.9.9.9 nameserver: ${resolvedIP}`);
    
    // Lookup the IP address of k6.io using the system's default DNS server.
    const lookupIP = await dns.lookup('k6.io');
    console.log(`k6.io IP as looked up by the system's default DNS server: ${lookupIP}`);
}
```

### Example results

```

     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /

## API

### `dns.resolve(query, recordType, options)`

Resolves a DNS name to an IP address using the provided DNS server. It returns an array of IP addresses.

The `query` parameter is the DNS name to resolve, the `recordType` parameter is the type of DNS record to query for (e.g. 'A', 'AAAA', 'CNAME', 'NS', and 'PTR'), and the `options` parameter is an object that can contain the following properties:
- `nameserver` - the IP address and port of the DNS server to query. It should be in the format `ip:port`. If not provided, the system's default DNS server will be used.

Using the `dns.resolve()` operation will emit the following metrics:
- `dns_resolutions`: a [**Counter**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/metrics/) metric tracking the number of DNS resolutions performed.
- `dns_resolution_duration`: a [**Trend**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/metrics/) metric tracking the time taken to resolve the DNS.

### `dns.lookup(host)`

Lookups a host name using the system's default DNS server. It returns an array of IP addresses.

The `host` parameter is the DNS name to resolve.

Using the `dns.lookup()` operation will emit the following metrics:
- `dns_lookups`: a [**Counter**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/metrics/) metric tracking the number of DNS lookups performed.
- `dns_lookup_duration`: A [**Trend**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/metrics/) metric tracking the time taken to lookup the DNS.
