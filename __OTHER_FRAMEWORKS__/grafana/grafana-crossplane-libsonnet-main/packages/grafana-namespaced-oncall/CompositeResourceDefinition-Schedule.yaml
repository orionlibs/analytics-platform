                        The name of the managed resource inside the Provider.
                        By default Providers give external resources the same name as the Kubernetes object. A provider uses the external name to lookup a managed resource in an external system. The provider looks up the resource in the external system to determine if it exists, and if it matches the managed resource’s desired state. If the provider can’t find the resource, it creates it.

                        WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                        Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                        be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                        and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                        This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                        PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                        and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                        each other.
