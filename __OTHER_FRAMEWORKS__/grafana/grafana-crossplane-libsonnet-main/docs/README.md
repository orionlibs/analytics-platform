# grafanaplane

This repository provides a set of Crossplane Configurations packages and and accompanying Jsonnet library.

The Configuration packages provide a set of (namespaced) composition/XRD pairs that map directly to their non-namespaced Managed resources equivalents.

The library consists of two parts, the manually written functions to get started quicly and the full library in `zz/`. They can be used in combination with each other.

Most of this library is generated: the Compositions/XRDs packages, Configurations and the library in `zz/`.
